Dear Salesforce Hiring Team,
 
With the utmost eagerness, I want to express my interest & passion for the Professional Services Operations Analyst role at Adobe. As someone who has worked in sales operations with efficient skills in Salesforce and other related functions, I know my versatile skills and qualifications will make me an asset to the team.

As you will find on my resume, I have had a variety of experiences with many different roles in Sales Operations from my time at Wonsulting and other roles. I am looking to make the next step in my career by leveraging my sales operations and computer science skills to increase client engagements within your company.
 
As a prospective intern, I immediately can bring the following qualities to the team:
 
Previous Sales Operations and Project Management Experience: In my previous experience as a Sales Operations Intern at Wonsulting, I collaborated with sales teams through platforms including Salesforce and Workfront. In these platforms, we ensured our processes were efficient for Account Executives and kept track of commissions to ensure payments were accurate. I also managed projects by figuring out strategic goals on Adobe Workfront and managed operational process improvements. 
 
Collaboration, Priority, and Adaptability Skills: Throughout my experiences, I’ve collaborated with both internal and external stakeholders to present data regarding our business models. By doing so, I created stronger relationships with senior level executives and organizations including finance, legal, and sales. I’ve worked on multiple projects at once and exceeded expectations in each of my roles.
 
While my resume provides a quick summary of my experiences, I hope to have the opportunity to share how I can bring value to your company’s needs.
 
Sincerely,
 
Wonsulting Wendy
